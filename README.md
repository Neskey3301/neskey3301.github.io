I HATE WEB DEVELOPMENT I HATE WEB DEVELOPMENT I  HATE WEB DEVELOPMENT
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

*cough* okay

hi this is personal website :>

i made it through a combination of figma editor and teleportHQ editor
but especially teleport, shoutout to the devs for making the best free web design tool out there, and i know because i was looking for a decent one for a solid 2 days :,3

despite the nightmare in html form that i've made, i decided to keep this public.
but please remember *i am not a web developer*, this was barely put together with scotch tape and staples. but you can read it for the comedy value i guess

all pixelart and gifs were done by me, along with the demo.

(also sorry if you're on mobile or have a screen bigger or smaller than 1920x1080 forgive me love u XX)
